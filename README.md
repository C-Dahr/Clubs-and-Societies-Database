This is the README file for Cameron Dahr's branch of the Team11Repository We split our team into two smaller groups. One called Web and the other called Control. I was a part of the web branch focusing on HTML and Servlets. Zachary Ferguson and I would work on the HTML and Servlets in a peer programming type of way so we both had some input on all the code with HTML and Servlets.

The code that I actually wrote is in:

ClubAdminServlet.java

LoginServlet.java

MainAdminServlet.java

ManageClubAdminAccessServlet.java

ProcessClubAdminRequestServlet.java

ProcessClubRequestServlet.java 

ViewClubAdminRequestServlet.java  

ViewClubRequestServlet.java 

CreateClubServlet.java

We would tweak each others code so this list is not solely my own work but I wrote most if not all of the above classes.
