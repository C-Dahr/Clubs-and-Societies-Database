# Team11ProjectRepository
This is the README file for Zachary Ferguson's branch of the Team11Repository
We split our team into two smaller groups. One called Web and the other called Control.
I was a part of the web branch focusing on HTML and Servlets.
Cameron Dahr and I would work on it in a peer programming type of way so we had some input on all the code with HTML and Servlets

The code that I actually wrote is:

BrowseClubsServlet.java 

ChangedClubServlet.java 

CreateClubRequestServlet.java

EditClubServlet.java

RequestClubAdminAccessServlet.java

SearchClubsServlet.java

ViewClubInfoServlet.java

and all the HTML files

We would tweak eachothers code so this list is not solely my code but I wrote most if not all of it.
